# Medical Inventory Checker üè•

An AI-powered application for checking medical case inventory using computer vision and multimodal models. Designed for medical equipment cases containing screws, tools, and instruments.

## Features

- **Visual Inventory Comparison**: Compare before/after images of medical cases
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses state-of-the-art vision models
- **Difference Highlighting**: Visually marks differences between inventory states
- **Multiple Model Support**: Test different vision models for optimal accuracy

## How to Use

1. Upload a "before" image of your medical case
2. Upload an "after" image of the medical case
3. Select the AI model to use (Qwen2.5-VL recommended)
4. Click "Check Inventory" to analyze differences
